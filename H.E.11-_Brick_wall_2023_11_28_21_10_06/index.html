      <h1>Sacred Brick Wall</h1>

      <h2>How To Use:</h2>
      <p2> Click through the buttons below the brick wall to randomly populate it. Make the wall as chaotic as you want. When walking around a town, I always love observing how brick walls accumulate foliage, various plastered on posters, artists' tags, and embrace dilapidation. I wanted to give the user a chance to create a well loved public wall.</p2>
